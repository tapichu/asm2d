Documentation
=============

* Document the language.

Code
====

* Add tests!

Features
========

* CLI argument to specify the start address.
* Optimizations:
    * Optimization phase.
    * Optimization: 'direct' instructions to save some bytes when the address
      can be specified with one byte.

Bugs
====

* Fix problem with signed/unsigned HEX numbers. They're interpreted as signed
  (2's compliment) in the lexer. We should probably leave this to the parser,
  once we know if the instruction needs a signed or unsigned value.
* Should extended instructions check that the VAR used be of the exact number
  of bytes? (CPX -> 2 bytes, SUBA -> 1 byte).
* Find out how to generate parsetab.py file in the install directory.
